### CRITICAL REQUIERMENT Querying Rules:
1.  **Status:** To find closed tickets, you must filter where `status_description` is exactly '>closed'.
2.  **Dates:** This is a very important rule. All date fields (like `date_closed`, `date_entered`) are DATETIME fields, which means they contain both a date and a time (e.g., '2025-07-31 14:30:00').
    - **WRONG:** A query like `WHERE date_closed = '2025-07-31'` will NEVER work because it tries to match the time '00:00:00'.
    - **CORRECT:** To correctly query for a single day, you MUST remove the time component by casting the column to a DATE.
    - **Example:** `WHERE CAST(date_closed AS DATE) = '2025-07-31'`
3.  **Company Names:** When a user asks about a company, you must use a `LIKE` clause with wildcards to match the `company_name` field. For example: `WHERE company_name LIKE '%acme%'`.
4.  **Limiting Results:** When a user asks for "top N" or "bottom N" results, you MUST use the `TOP N` clause at the beginning of the query. For example: `SELECT TOP 10 ...`.
5.  **Dates Time Zones** and datetime field ending in '_UTC' is in utc time and must be converted to server local time. Additionally, any datetime field NOT ending in utc is already in local server time.
6. **Help desk boards**: when no board_name (board) is mentioned assume help desk (hd) only. The tickets are found this way: (
	(Board_name like 'GTS - Team %) or (Board_name = 'GTS - Help Desk) and (Board Name <> 'GTS - Team Training'))
7. **Alert(s) board**: when asking for alert ticket the what to find them is (Board_name = 'GTS - Alerts')
8. **Month only**: when a month is mentioned with no year, assume the current year. 
9. **Work Flows**:the following 'technicians' are workflows or integrations: 'Automate', 'Automation', 'CWUTRIntegrator', 'NinjaAPI', 'OrdersUpdater', 'REWST', 'Thread', 'UserManager', 'Workflow', 'zadmin'
10. **WorkFlows**: when asking about techs, always exclude workflows (see rule 9).
11. **Companies**:companies that have a company_status_desc like 'FORMER CLIENT' or 'Inactive/Gone' have been offboard and are not active.
12. **Offbording**: a company offboarding date can be inferred by looking at the last updated date in conjunction with rule 11.
13. **Tech Titles**: when asking of techs the can be identified by the following titles ([Member_Type_Desc]): "Jr. Sys Admin:, "Tech Support Analyst", "Team Lead", "First Call Tech", "Sys Admin"
14. **Team Leads**: team lead can be identified by the title ([Member_Type_Desc]) "Team Lead"
15. **Time in Tickets**: the actual hours in a ticket is all the time recorded by all techs for that ticket.
16. **Time entries**: time for an individual tech is found in v_rpt_time by member_id
17. **time in tickets**: to find who recorded time in a ticket search for the ticket number in v_rpt_time.
18. **Engineering tickets**: engineering ticket can be found on the "GTS - Engineering" board.
